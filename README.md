# Employee-Attrition-Analysis-

This project explores the patterns and drivers behind employee attrition using a synthetic dataset of 59,600 employees. Built entirely in Power BI as part of my learning journey at Vephla University, the goal was to uncover actionable insights that can help organizations identify at-risk employee groups and design effective retention strategies.

Project Overview

Employee attrition is a critical issue for many organizations, impacting both productivity and culture. This analysis focuses on understanding which demographic, job-level, and perception-based factors are most associated with employee turnover. By using data-driven approaches, the project reveals key workforce trends and helps decision-makers prioritize intervention efforts.

Key Questions Explored

What is the overall attrition rate across the company?

Which age groups, job levels, and departments face the highest attrition?

How does job satisfaction correlate with actual retention behavior?

What role does education level, gender, income, and promotion history play in attrition?

Are there specific combinations of factors that strongly predict employee exits?

Dataset Details

Source: Synthetic Employee Attrition Dataset (Kaggle)

Total Employees: 59,600

Key Fields: Age, Gender, Marital Status, Education, Job Role, Job Level, Monthly Income, Years at Company, Number of Promotions, Work-Life Balance, Job Satisfaction, Remote Work Status, Commute Distance, Leadership Opportunities, Innovation Opportunities

Analytical Techniques

Data modeling and custom measures using DAX in Power BI

Grouping and categorization using calculated columns (e.g., Age Group, Satisfaction Score)

Attrition Rate = Total Employees Who Left / Total Employees

Average Promotion per Year = Total Promotions / Total Years at Company

Custom visual dashboards to segment data by department, age group, and role

Insights Generated

The analysis showed that entry-level employees and those aged 18–25 have the highest attrition rates. Despite a high overall job satisfaction score, 47.55% of the workforce had left, suggesting a gap between perception and behavior. Attrition was also higher among male employees and those with Bachelor’s or Master’s degrees, while PhD holders showed stronger retention. Interestingly, job role had minimal influence on attrition, pointing to structural or cultural factors as the real drivers.

Recommendations

Improve onboarding and early-career support for entry-level staff

Focus on career development and mentorship for younger employees

Reevaluate how job satisfaction is measured and reported

Use experienced staff as mentors to improve retention culture

Introduce real-time dashboards to monitor attrition trends and flag risks early
